    <h2>About the T‑Rex</h2>
    <p>
        The Tyrannosaurus Rex was one of the most powerful predators to ever walk the Earth. 
        With a bite force stronger than any land animal in history and a towering presence, 
        the T‑Rex dominated the late Cretaceous period. Its massive skull, powerful legs, 
        and keen senses made it an apex predator unlike any other.

    <h2>Evolution: From Apex Predator… to Chicken?</h2>
    <p>
        Believe it or not, modern birds are the closest living relatives of dinosaurs. 
        And yes — that includes the humble chicken. Evolution took the T‑Rex’s lineage 
        on a wild ride, transforming a 40‑foot super‑predator into a feathery, 
        occasionally confused barnyard animal. Nature has jokes.
